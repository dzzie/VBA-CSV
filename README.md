VBA-CSV
=======

VBA-CSV provides CSV (Comma-Separated Values) parsers and writer as VBA functions.
The CSV parsers read CSV text and return Collection or Array of the CSV table contents.
The CSV writer converts 2-dimensional array to CSV text.
* The parsers and writer are compliant with the CSV format defined in [RFC4180](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt), 
  which allows commas, line breaks, and double-quotes included in the fields.
* Function test procedure, performance test procedure and examples are included.
* The parser takes about 3 sec. for 8MB CSV, 8000 rows x 100 columns.
* The writer takes about 1 sec. for 8MB CSV, 8000 rows x 100 columns.
* The parsers do not fully check the syntax error (they parse correctly if the CSV has no syntax error).

Also includes [VBScript](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc392489.aspx) version in [VBScript folder](VBScript).

## Usage and Examples

#### ParseCSVToCollection
```vb.net
Function ParseCSVToCollection( csvText As String, 
                               Optional allowVariableNumOfFields As Boolean = False ) As Collection
```
###### [example]
```vb.net
    Dim csv As Collection
    Dim rec As Collection, fld As Variant

    Set csv = ParseCSVToCollection("aaa,bbb,ccc" & vbCr & "xxx,yyy,zzz")
    If csv Is Nothing Then
        Debug.Print Err.Number & " (" & Err.Source & ") " & Err.Description
    End If
    
    Debug.Print csv(1)(3) '----> ccc
    Debug.Print csv(2)(1) '----> xxx
    For Each rec In csv
      For Each fld In rec
        Debug.Print fld
      Next
    Next
```

`ParseCSVToCollection()` returns a Collection of records, and the record is a collection of fields.
If error occurs, it returns `Nothing` and the error information is set in `Err` object.
Optional boolean argument `allowVariableNumOfFields` specifies whether variable number of fields in records is allowed or handled as error.

#### ParseCSVToArray
```vb.net
Function ParseCSVToArray( csvText As String, 
                          Optional allowVariableNumOfFields As Boolean = False ) As Variant
```
###### [example]
```vb.net
    Dim csv As Variant
    Dim i As Long, j As Variant

    csv = ParseCSVToArray("aaa,bbb,ccc" & vbCr & "xxx,yyy,zzz")
    If IsNull(csv) Then
        Debug.Print Err.Number & " (" & Err.Source & ") " & Err.Description
    End If
    
    Debug.Print csv(1, 3) '----> ccc
    Debug.Print csv(2, 1) '----> xxx
    For i = LBound(csv, 1) To UBound(csv, 1)
      For j = LBound(csv, 2) To UBound(csv, 2)
        Debug.Print csv(i, j)
      Next
    Next
```

`ParseCSVToArray()` returns a Variant that contains 2-dimensional array - `String(1 To recordCount, 1 To fieldCount)`.
If error occurs, it returns `Null` and the error information is set in `Err` object.
If input text is zero-length (""), it returns empty array - `String(0 To -1)`.
Optional boolean argument `allowVariableNumOfFields` specifies whether variable number of fields in records is allowed or handled as error.

#### ConvertArrayToCSV
```vb.net
Function ConvertArrayToCSV( inArray As Variant,
                            Optional fmtDate As String = "yyyy/m/d",
                            Optional quoting As CSVUtilsQuote = CSVUtilsQuote.MINIMAL,
                            Optional recordSeparator As String = vbCrLf ) As String
```
###### [example]
```vb.net
    Dim csv As String
    Dim a(1 To 2, 1 To 2) As Variant
    a(1, 1) = DateSerial(1900, 4, 14)
    a(1, 2) = "Exposition Universelle de Paris 1900"
    a(2, 1) = DateSerial(1970, 3, 15)
    a(2, 2) = "Japan World Exposition, Osaka 1970"
    
    csv = ConvertArrayToCSV(a, "yyyy/mm/dd")
    If Err.Number <> 0 Then
        Debug.Print Err.Number & " (" & Err.Source & ") " & Err.Description
    End If
    
    Debug.Print csv
```

`ConvertArrayToCSV()` reads 2-dimensional array `inArray` and return CSV text.
If error occurs, it return the string "", and the error information is set in `Err` object.
`fmtDate` is used as the argument of text formatting function [`Format`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/office/gg251755.aspx) 
if an element of the array is `Date` type.
The optional argument `quoting` specifies what type of fields to be quoted:

* `MINIMAL`: Quoting only if it is necessary (the field includes double-quotes, comma, line breaks).
* `ALL`: Quoting all the fields.
* `NONNUMERIC`: Similar to MINIMAL, but quoting also all the String type fields.

The optional arugment `recordSeparator` specifies record separator (line terminator), default is CRLF.

#### SetCSVUtilsAnyErrorIsFatal
```vb.net
SetCSVUtilsAnyErrorIsFatal(value As Boolean)
```
###### [example]
```vb.net
    SetCSVUtilsAnyErrorIsFatal True
    SetCSVUtilsAnyErrorIsFatal False
```

This function changes error handling mode for CSV parsers and writer.

**False (default)** - When run-time error occurs, the parser function returns special value (`Nothing`,  `Null`, etc.), 
                      and the error information is set to properties of `Err` object.    
**True**            - Any run-time error that occurs is fatal (an error message is displayed and execution stops).

## Installation

## The CSV File format

There is no definitive standard for CSV (Comma-separated values) file format, however the most commonly accepted definition is 
[RFC4180](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). VBA-CSV is compliant with RFC 4180, while still allowing some flexibility 
where CSV text deviate from the definition.
The followings are the rules of CSV format such that VBA-CSV can handle correctly. 
(The rules indicated by *italic characters* don't exists in RFC4180)

1.  Each record is located on a separate line, delimited by a line break (CRLF, *CR, or LF*).

       ```
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx CRLF
       ```

2.  The last record in the file may or may not have an ending line break.
    *The CSV file containing nothing (= "") is recognized as empty (it has no record nor fields).*

       ```
       aaa,bbb,ccc CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx
       ```

3.  Within each record, there may be one or more fields, separated by commas.
      
       ```
       aaa,bbb,ccc
       ```

4.  Each record should contain the same number of fields throughout the file.

5.  Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes.  

       ```
       "aaa","bbb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx
       ```
6.  Fields containing line breaks, double quotes, and commas should be enclosed in double-quotes.
       
       ```
       "aaa","b CRLF
       bb","ccc" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx
       ```

7.  If double-quotes are used to enclose fields, then a double-quote
       appearing inside a field must be escaped by preceding it with
       another double quote.

       ```
       "aaa","b""bb","ccc"
       ```

8.    Spaces *(including tabs)* are considered part of a field and should not be ignored.
      *If fields are enclosed with double quotes, then leading and trailing spaces outside of double quotes are ignored.*

       ```
       " aaa", "bbb", ccc
       ```
9.    *The special quotation expression (="CONTENT") is allowed inside of the double-quotes.*
      *CONTENT (field content) must not include any double-quote (").*
      *MS Excel can read this.*

       ```
       aaa,"=""bbb""",ccc
       ```
